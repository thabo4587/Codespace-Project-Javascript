    //The above line of code initiates an object and this a reference data type in Javascript with name and chips as properties.I found it difficult to understand methods on objects at first but with more examples I grasped the concept.Objects are interstingly considered mutable data types which means they can be modified.

    let cards = [];
    let sum = 0;
    let hasBlackJack = false;
    let isAlive = false;
    let message = "";
  //The above lines of code initialise variables using the let keyword which will allow us to reassign these variables if we need to.Some of the data types initialized are an empty string and an empty array followed by a boolean data type and one number 0 which is a falsy data type in javascript.If we used const to create the variables then we would not have the ability to change them.

  //The above lines of code make use of the DOM and the getElementById() method is used to access element in our HTML and in this case the id attribute is used and the id attribute always has a unique value within the document.My struggles with this topic was understand the fact that there are several other methods that can be used to access and manipulate the elements in the DOM and I was confused as to which one is suitable for building my game.Some methods return a representation of the HTML element being referenced and some return data types such as node list and HTML lists which can be converted into arrays when needed.

    playerEl.textContent = player.name + ": $" + player.chips;
  //The above line of code makes use of a property of the DOM called textContent and it's purpose is to allow developers to add or reference the text contained inside HTML tags.There are two methods for achieving this and a difficulty I encountered was understanding the difference between them. What I learnt is that if you want to deal with the actual text content of an element, including hidden elements, use textContent. If you want to deal with the visible text content as it appears on the page, considering styles and visibility, use innerText.I had a higher preference for the textContent property since it gives me more information.

            return 11;
        } else {
            return randomNumber;
        }
    }
  //The above line of code defines a function that will allows us to randomly select a card.The first line of code makes use of the Math.floor() method which is used to strictly obtain integers and the Math.random() generates a random number between 1 and 13 where 13 is included.These are methods provided by the Javascript Math object.This code is followed by if staments which check whether the randonNumber generated is either 1 or greater than 10.If these two conditions are not met the functions return the Randmnumber  and if condition is met it returns 10 and id-f conditon 2 is met it returns the number 11 my struggles with this part was understanding the difference between if and else if statements.

        sum = firstCard + secondCard;
        renderGame();
    }
  //This function is reasponsible for starting the game uwhen the user clicks the start game button.This function initialises a boolean variable which checks whether a player is alive or not.The preceding lines of code initialise our first and second card numbers and these will be random numbers since the getRandomCArd function is invoked after that these two numbers are added and stored in an array and their sum is also calculated.After that the renderGame function is invoked before defined which can be done with function however the same cannot be achieved with variables.Being able to invoke function before defining them allows developer to organise their code for maximum functionality.

    function renderGame() {
        cardsEl.textContent = "Cards: ";
        for (let i = 0; i < cards.length; i++) {
            cardsEl.textContent += cards[i] + " ";
        }

        sumEl.textContent = "Sum: " + sum;
        if (sum <= 20) {
            message = "Do you want to draw a new card?";
        } else if (sum === 21) {
            message = "You've got Blackjack!";
            hasBlackJack = true;
        } else {
            message = "You're out of the game!";
            isAlive = false;
        }
        messageEl.textContent = message;
    }

  //The above line of code finally defines the renderGame function adn it assumes that we have defined the variable we are using.I also made use of a for loop since it's an array I could use forEach method to loop through the array of length 2 containing the random cards and these are rendered on the screen for our player to see using the textContent property.This code is mainly responsible for the BlackJakc functionality of our game since it contained if statements which checks whether the sum of our random cards is equal to ,less that or greater than 21 and it gives the player a message and it also changes the boolean variables isAlive and hasBlackJack uses the textContent property to render the text give by the message on the screen.What I learned from the above line of code was how if statements can be used for control in programming and game development.
    function newCard() {
        if (isAlive && !hasBlackJack) {
            let card = getRandomCard();
            sum += card;
            cards.push(card);
            renderGame();
        }
    }
  
  //This function will determine whether the user can draw a new card and the if staments controls the conditions under which a new card can be drawn.It checks whether the player is still alive and if they have blackjack and if they do it generates a random card and adds it to the sum and adds it to the array containing the two cards.Lastly the renderGame() function which was defined above is invoked.
